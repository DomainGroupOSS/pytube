PyTube: YouTube Wrapper for Minimalists
========================================

PyTube is an Apache2 Licensed lightweight YouTube wrapper, written in Python,
for minimalists.

Working hard to release v0.2.1! Fully documented, improved flexibility, a great
CLI, and will finally be available on PyPI!
